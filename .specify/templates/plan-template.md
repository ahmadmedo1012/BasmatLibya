# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]

**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All implementation plans MUST pass gates derived from the ratified Constitution at
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Each principle maps to one or more gates:

- **G1 — Arabic-First & RTL by Default**: every user-facing surface built RTL-first
  (Constitution Principle I).
- **G2 — Shared Typed Contracts (Schema-First)**: all wire contracts in
  `packages/shared` as zod schemas (Principle II).
- **G3 — Privacy by Design**: no auth, no accounts, 30-day retention enforced
  (Principle III).
- **G4 — Push-Based Real-Time Progress**: Socket.IO for all progress updates,
  never polling (Principle IV).
- **G5 — AI-Ready & Simplicity**: enrichment slot reserved as no-op; YAGNI;
  one-command dev (Principle V).
- **G6 — Technology Stack Constraints**: MUST use ratified stack; deviation
  requires Complexity Tracking justification.
- **G7 — Development Workflow Compliance**: speckit flow, Conventional Commits,
  integration tests for contract changes.

Violations MUST be documented in the Complexity Tracking section with justification
before Phase 0 begins.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
